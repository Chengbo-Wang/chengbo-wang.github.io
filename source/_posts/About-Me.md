### About Me
I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Design](http://design.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Hunan University](https://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professor [Yizhen Lao](https://yizhenlao.github.io/). 

My research interests lie broadly in computer vision and machine learning, and my primary research concentration is 3D vision.

Previously I obtained my Master’s degree from [Tianjin University](https://en.tju.edu.cn/), and Bachelor’s degree in Structural Engineering from [Hunan University](https://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/).
